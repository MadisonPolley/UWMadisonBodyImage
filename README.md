# UWMadisonBodyImage
This repository is comprised of the original csv data as well as all data cleaning and visualization files for my Stat 433: Data Science in R class.

The purpose of this project is to examine and visualize the complexities of body image among students at UW-Madison in order to create a compelling story about how college students view themselves and their bodies.
